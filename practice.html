    <h1>Knowledge Addict</h1>  <!--First Heading-->
    <p>That's not a thing right? Lately I've found myself having better days
        as long as I've learned something new AND touched up on something 
        that I've learned before. I.E. I find sites such as <a href="
        https://www.alison.com" target="_blank">
        Alison</a> and try to take a course in anything. Afterwards I'd move
        on to a task that'd require a skill I've learned in the past. Ranging
        from looking to refinance a loan for lower payment and/or rate(this
        one is rare but AWESOME if everything works in my favor), testing out a 
        new cooking or cleaning technique, fun stretch or martial art stance
        for better balance and force placement, etc. Haha, I think I've fell
        into this mind set because of a video game I played call 'Persona 5'.

        <br/>Minus the fictional stuff, that's pretty much all you do in that game.
        Good Stuff.</p><hr>
